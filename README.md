# Tactics

A simple prototype for recreating the movement of the battles of mega man battle network

## Controls
`Arrow Keys` - Move.
`S` - Attack
`D` - Defense

**This project is not longer development** The reason is that the project was supposed to only
recreate the grid movement of the battle and nothing else.
